“And how has it been, adjusting to a newborn?” “Kat’s colicky—doesn’t sleep very well.” Just like me. When she woke up multiple times each night, I got up with her, sometimes fed her a bottle Gianna had pumped beforehand, and held her until she fell back to sleep. Gianna had insisted she do it all at first, but I’d quickly ended that.

“You’ve been married how long now?” “A year.” To be exact, three-hundred-and-eighty-five days. I’d proposed to Gianna again with a ring, a bended knee, and even a nice dinner. She hadn’t wanted another wedding, so we’d gotten married at the courthouse. I had the date tattooed on my ribs right next to Andromeda.

I breathed against his lips, “Tell me you love me again.” “I love you, malyshka.” “I love you, too, you know?” He stilled, and then a rough sound rumbled in his chest. He lifted me so my eyes were level with his, brushed his lips across mine, and said in a deep, almost apologetic rasp, “I’m never letting you go now.”

He cupped my face with a palm, running a thumb across my cheek. “Moya zvezdochka.” I felt the intensity of his relief in the way his hand shook slightly, and it made my throat tighten. I suddenly knew this was the only man I wanted to do this with. Happiness pinged off the walls of my chest, leaving me feeling raw.

“I won’t marry another man I don’t know,” I said quietly. His teeth clenched. I gave him a chance to fill the silence between us. He didn’t. A tear ran down my cheek, and my throat tried to close around the words before they could escape. “I can’t be with you and only get half of you anymore.”

Is this some form of karma? Is it payback for tormenting her for years, for not realizing what I had? She’s my wife now, yet in some ways, it feels like she’ll never fully be mine. She’s given me her body, but that’s not all I want.

“Why can’t I tell them to fuck themselves?” I asked him as Adriana handed me my bracelets. “Because, to the rest of the world, you are the fiancée to one of the most powerful men in this country—the prince of Chicago. You aren’t the Boss to them. They want a Kate Middleton or a first lady, someone to kiss babies and write big checks on behalf of your fiancé,” my father snapped at me, causing me to stop and just stare into his dying eyes.

You, Melody Nicci Giovanni, will not walk the same path your mother and I did. You will support your husband, guide him when needed, and stand by his side and his side alone. You will be a damn Callahan, and you will make sure both families, past and present, rise!”

When I had found out whom I was to marry years ago, I had slowly but surely bought, bribed, and taken “government-protected” lands just far enough away from the Callahan Manor to give my men a place for their families that was nearer to where I would be staying. The houses were not anything close to Callahan Manor or my home here, but they were nice, common family homes that would typically be found in the suburbs of Chicago.

It was the exact opposite of my home, sadly. Callahan Manor was a modern day fortress. Beyond the cream marble floors that stretched for as far as the eye could see, the double grand stair cases framed with black iron, and the engraved wooden French doors, there was nothing but forty-six thousand square feet of illegal activity. There were no statues, barely any plants, and only modern paintings. Everything was simple, crisp, and clean.

My mind was so messed up. I couldn’t think straight, all I could see was a younger version of my fiancée, clinging to a wing in the middle of the fucking Atlantic Ocean. In the dark. Just how I fucking left her. “Fuck.” My father was right. I truly needed to grovel, but even that wouldn’t change things. It wouldn’t be enough.

There was something about Liam Callahan. He was immature, rowdy, and impatient. Those were just the kinder things I could think of, and yet I knew he smelled like cinnamon, spices, and apples. I had taken the time to reflect on his scent, even enjoyed it. Ugh. On top of that, I enjoyed how he looked up close.

“How long have we been married? Ten fucking days, Liam? Who falls in love in ten fucking days? Who feels anything in ten fucking days! That isn’t normal!” “I do.” He glared at the ceiling. “We aren’t normal. Normal people don’t shoot other people almost daily. Normal people don’t sell drugs nor are they at risk of dying every day. I don’t have any time to waste going through the motions. Either I like it or I don’t. Either I’m in or I’m out. I do not walk in the middle.”

Mel grabbed the side of my face with one hand and gripped tightly to my hands with the other. “You’re going to be okay,” she whispered. “I swear. You’re going to be okay.”

She was worried, scared, and caring as she held onto me. I smiled at her and she smiled at me. “You’re not alone, Liam,” she whispered, and I knew that the pain, the burning in my chest, was worth it. This was so fucking worth it. I took a small amount of pleasure in the panic in her eyes as mine closed.

Hearing the door close, I smiled to myself. In the last three weeks, my relationship with Liam had changed drastically. We no longer fought with one about personal matters. Instead, most of our issues were with the job, and even those were few and far between. Sometimes our plan of attack didn’t mesh well, and the only way we could settle it was to “fuck it out.” Neither of us complained about that though, and I was sure he disagreed with me sometimes just so we could have sex afterward, the little prick. Yet, I found myself smiling more often

I hadn’t known before that I would have no other choice than to say I was in love with Melody Nicci Callahan. I loved how she broke people’s noses, how she smiled whenever we killed someone. I loved the way she moaned my name while we made love, only to slap me afterward.

Melody stepped inside, making me want to drop to my knees and kiss her feet. She was an absolute vision in the long, strapless white dress she wore. She looked like a goddess or an angel, and I felt lucky to even stand before her.

“You’re pregnant,” I whispered. She nodded. “Ten weeks.” My legs gave out under me, and I found myself on my knees, my head on her stomach. I couldn’t hear anything, but I felt so humbled, in love, and overjoyed. Her hands found their way into my hair again as I kissed her stomach.

“Yes, what?” he says with a raised brow. Oh, my sweet puppy did not come to play. I knew I sensed a hunger for domination in him. I don’t think Ryan has ever let himself explore his sexuality. He’s unsure of his likes, his cravings. Each time I’ve said or done something he reacts to, I’ve taken note. In this moment, I know exactly what he wants.
